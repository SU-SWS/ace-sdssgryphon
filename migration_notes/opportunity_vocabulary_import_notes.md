# Opportunity Migration: Vocabulary Import Notes

- After copying the vocabulary configuration files, import configuration in your target site.
- If any terms are required for testing or demo content, add them manually or migrate them as needed.
- Confirm that the vocabularies are available and referenced fields work as expected in the Opportunity content type.

_This note provides guidance for post-migration steps for vocabularies._
